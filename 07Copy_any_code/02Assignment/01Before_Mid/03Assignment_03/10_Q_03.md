/*
10. Create a class called ship that incorporates a ship’s number and location. Use the
approach of Exercise 8 to number each ship object as it is created. Use two variables of
the angle class from Exercise 7 to represent the ship’s latitude and longitude. A member
function of the ship class should get a position from the user and store it in the object;
another should report the serial number and position. Write a main() program that cre-
ates three ships, asks the user to input the position of each, and then displays each ship’s
number and position.
