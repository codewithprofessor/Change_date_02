What is constructor??
A constructor is a special type of member function that is called automatically when an object is created. In C++, a constructor has the same name as that of the class and it does not have a return type. For example, class Wall { public: // create a constructor Wall() { // code } };

constructor overload:

The technique of having two (or more) constructors in a class is known as constructor overloading. A class can have multiple constructors that differ in the number and/or type of their parameters.

Constructors can be overloaded in a similar way as function overloading. Overloaded constructors have the same name (name of the class) but the different number of arguments.
